### Sprint 0 - Foundation

- Next.js App Router initial setup
- TypeScript & strict configuration

- Core animation packages added (`gsap`, `lenis`)
- Global CSS, design tokens, utility baseline

- Full build and typecheck verification passed

### Sprint 1 - Visual Foundation + Global Site Shell

- Refined design token system (`tokens.css`) for Light and Dark themes
- Typography foundation (`Manrope` sans-serif + `Cormorant Garamond` editorial serif via `next/font`)
- Light theme (`#f5f3ee` warm off-white, `#121212` charcoal text) & Dark theme (`#0b0b0b` deep charcoal, `#f3f0e8` warm text)
- Zero-flash inline head script theme initialization & `ThemeProvider` state persistence
- Accessible `ThemeToggle` component with Sun/Moon SVG icons
- Sticky global `Header` with logo text mark, desktop navigation, and contact action button
- Accessible full-screen `MobileNav` overlay menu with numbered items, Escape key listener, and scroll lock
- Single application-level Lenis smooth scrolling integration with reduced motion fallback
- Fine-pointer custom desktop cursor tracking (`CustomCursor`) with hover states for interactive targets
- Reusable primitives (`Container`, `Section`, `Button`)
- Temporary homepage canvas (`src/app/page.tsx`) demonstrating typography, palette, theme toggle, and smooth scrolling
- Minimal placeholder pages for all routes (`/the-answer`, `/cast`, `/crew`, `/gallery`, `/the-answer-ai`, `/contact`)

### Sprint 2A — Header Finalization

- Official FocusTV `logo.png` integrated into Header via `next/image` (replaces temporary text mark)
- Official `favicon.png` registered as `src/app/icon.png` via Next.js App Router conventions
- Final desktop navigation: Home, Cast, Team, Gallery, The Answer AI (with Contact as a CTA button)
- Final mobile navigation: matching the desktop link set
- Header uses `position: fixed` and starts transparent over the hero
- `IntersectionObserver` on a `#top-sentinel` sentinel element drives the transparent → solid header state change (no scroll event per frame)
- Scrolled state: Light theme warm off-white + backdrop blur / Dark theme deep charcoal + backdrop blur
- Nav link hover: text transitions to brand gold + thin animated gold underline grows left-to-right
- Active nav link: persistent gold underline indicator
- Contact button: cinematic dark-sweep hover (pseudo-element `scaleX` wipe from left)
- Homepage temporary surface: clean `100svh` placeholder for header contrast testing
- All Sprint 2A changes are **approved** and finalized in source control.

## 5. Active Sprint

**Sprint:** Sprint 2B — Homepage Hero Video Integration
---

## 6. Risks

### Hero Video Weight

Mitigation:
Use optimized video + poster, avoid heavy initial embed.

### AI Regression

Mitigation:
Strict `AGENTS.md`, small scoped tasks, review diffs before commit.

### Production Hosting Compatibility

Mitigation:
Check Hostinger plan before final deployment architecture is locked.

### Design Becoming Generic

Mitigation:
Use the Design Document, reference sites, varied compositions, and client review after major sections.

### Too Much Motion

Mitigation:
Motion review, reduced-motion support, mobile performance testing.

---

## 7. Current Blockers

No immediate blocker for project setup.

Production deployment details remain intentionally deferred until the Hostinger plan is confirmed.

---

## 8. Next Recommended Action

Visually review the Sprint 2A Header, then approve for commit and push.

Next sprint: begin Sprint 2B — Homepage Hero Video Integration once the video file is provided.
